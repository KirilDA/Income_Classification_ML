# Income_Classification_ML

Project Overview: 
  This project focuses on predicting whether an individual's income exceeds $50K per year based on demographic and employment-related factors.
  The primary model used is Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), with results compared against Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Gaussian      Naive Bayes (GaussianNB) to evaluate predictive performance.

Objectives:
  Develop a classification model to predict income categories (>=50K, <50K).
  Analyze and compare the performance of multiple machine learning algorithms.
  Identify which features most strongly influence income prediction.

Dataset: 
  Contains: 'nationality','age','workclass','fnlwgt','education','marital_status','occupation','specialty','relationship','race','sex','capital-                 gain','capital-loss','hours_per_week','native_country','income'

Technologies Used:
  Python, 
  libraries:(pandas,numpy,sklearn,xgboost,sklearn.linear_model,LogisticRegression,XGBClassifier...)

Results and Presentation: 
  A presentation (PDF) is included in the project folder.
  It summarizes:
  Model performance comparisons
  Accuracy metrics and confusion matrices
  Key visualizations created using Python’s data visualization libraries
  It is written in Bulgarian.
